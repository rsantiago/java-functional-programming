#Method Reference in Java

---
There are 4 kinds:
- **object::methodName** - When you want reference an instance method rather than a static method
- **ClassName::methodName** - When you want a class static method to be called as your lambda
- **ClassName::new** - When you want to pass the constructor function as a parameter
- **ClassName::instanceMethod** - When you want to reference a method from an object that is being treated in a collections or stream operation
