#Closures
A closure is a function that refers to free variables in its lexical context/scope
- **Function** - a block of code structure that takes an input, issues an output
- **Free Variables** - identified, used, but not defined by the closure
- **Lexical Context/Scope** - A convention that sets the scope of a variable so that it can only be called within the block of code in which it is defined

See the code for a clear explanation.
